# phaser-roguelike

To run the project after unpacking the zip file do this: 
In terminal run command npm i inside the roguelike folder to load required files the project uses (once at start).
Npm command naturally requires node package manager, which you can get by installing node from https://nodejs.org/en.

After that if you run the command npm run dev the game should show up playable in localhost with the provided link 
the terminal gives (which goes something like this http://localhost:8080/).
